      <h1>Starbucks</h1>
      <h2>Howard Schultz and Starbucks Coffee Company</h2>
      <h4>Prologue: International Expansion</h4>
      <p>
        On August 2, 1996, Starbucks Coffee Company opened its first store outside North America. Like many of its U.S. and Canadian outlets, the new store was located in a busy district of a prominent city—Tokyo. Starbucks managers had devoted much time to selecting the site, designing the store’s layout and fixtures, training its staff, and publicizing its introduction. A series of events, including receptions and public samplings, attracted consumer interest in the new store’s specialty coffee drinks, whole (unground) coffee beans, and pastries. For example, a man with a container of iced coffee in his backpack and a long hose poured shots of the cold beverage for passersby on the sidewalk.1 Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz flew in from the  company’s Seattle headquarters  to celebrate the opening and observe consumers’ reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new store was situated at a prime corner in Tokyo’s swank Ginza district. Surrounded by commercial activity, the establishment was bound to attract attention from thousands of pedestrians each day. In keeping with established practice, the company intended to rely on consumer word of mouth rather than on traditional advertising. The Starbucks brand had developed quickly in the United States and Canada, gaining widespread recognition and interest among consumers in these countries. In entering Asia, Schultz and his senior management team were betting that the company’s reputation would have broader appeal. As the store opening approached, however, the CEO could   not avoid some last-minute worries about Tokyo customers’ response. “What,” he asked himself, “could the name Starbucks possibly mean to the Japanese?”
      </p>
      <p>
        August 2 in Tokyo was a hot day—95 degrees Fahrenheit with almost 100% humidity. “I had no idea Tokyo could be so hot,” Schultz remembered. But Japanese customers, he could see, were not deterred. Customers filled the store from opening to closing, lining up 40 to 50 people deep to try Starbucks coffee. Businessmen in suits came, as did elegantly dressed women and students with  books and backpacks. Some customers bought Frappuccino® blended coffee drinks, which Starbucks had invented a year earlier. “We had been warned that, culturally, the Japanese refuse to carry to-go food or beverages on the street,” Schultz recalled. “Yet many customers were walking out the door proudly carrying their Starbucks cups—with the logo showing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the following days and weeks, consumers of all ages continued to crowd into the new store and, at lunchtime, overflowed onto the sidewalk. Some came to buy coffee beans. Some came to sample the ambience in the city’s newest coffee bar. Others, who had heard of Starbucks, wanted to learn more about the brand and its offerings. Most people standing in line intended to buy a caffe latte, cappuccino, or other specialty coffee drink that they associated with the young company.  Schultz was impressed by the customers’ enthusiasm. The Starbucks brand, he realized, “had the same power in Tokyo that it had in New York and Seattle. It had taken on a life of its own.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Schultz had bought the company in 1987, when it was still a small Seattle retailer, mainly selling coffee beans. In the ensuing nine years, it had become the nation’s largest purveyor of specialty  coffee, selling the beverage served in various ways, along with coffee beans and related food and merchandise. Between 1992 and 1996, annual revenues had increased more than 650%, climbing to almost $700 million (Exhibit 5).
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of this increase had been driven by the swift proliferation of company-owned stores, with   the rest of it coming from two thriving divisions—mail order, and specialty sales, which sold coffee to restaurants and other institutional purchasers. In 1987, Starbucks had 11 outlets; nine years later, over 900. In fiscal 1996 alone, the company opened 330 outlets, an average of almost one a day.6 As the business moved into new U.S. and Canadian urban markets, consumer awareness of specialty coffee and the Starbucks brand widened considerably. By the mid-1990s, millions of North Americans associated the company’s name with superior dark-roast coffee, customized espresso drinks, responsive customer service, and an appealing store experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alliances with Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Pepsi-Cola Company, Capitol Records, Barnes & Noble, United Airlines, and other organizations promised to broaden the Starbucks product  line, distribution channels, and name recognition. Marketing experts and financial analysts, impressed with the company’s growth and impact on the larger coffee industry, regarded Starbucks as one of   the strongest young consumer brands in North America.7 It was an identity that commanded broad awareness and strong buyer loyalty. In 1995, for example, the average Starbucks customer in North America visited a company store 18 times a month.8 Such loyalty, as Schultz and his colleagues understood, constituted a vital source of advantage in the increasingly competitive markets for specialty coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consumers’ attachment to the Starbucks brand was not based on mass advertising or promotion.  It was based, Schultz believed, on their experience in company stores: on their reactions to the coffee, the people who made and served it, and the stores’ atmosphere and sense of community. This experience, he said, “earned customers’ trust by speaking to their hearts as well as their heads.”9 As they debated international expansion in 1995 and 1996, he and other managers were fairly confident that the appeal of the Starbucks brand extended beyond North America and that consumers around the world would respond enthusiastically to the store experience. Senior executives were willing to  bet time, talent, money, and even the future integrity of the brand on these assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building a global brand, however, involved new imperatives. “We have created a set of expectations around an intimacy of experience that lies at the heart of what we are as a company and brand,” Schultz said. To be successful in the future, Starbucks must “continue to meet these expectations and sustain the trust that we have earned as we grow, as the scale, people, and complexity involved all increase.” How, he wondered, did an organization “get big and at the same time, stay small?”
      </p>
      <h4>The Rise of Coffee</h4>
      <p>
        The commercial market for coffee originated between 500 and 1000 A.D. when Arab traders brought the coffea arabica tree from its native Ethiopia to the Middle East for cultivation (Exhibit 1).  Coffee consumption spread quickly throughout the Moslem world, and in the sixteenth century, as relations improved between Moslems and Europeans, Venetian and Dutch traders introduced the product to Europe.12 Men, women, and some children initially embraced the beverage for its  supposed health benefits, but as coffee drinking spread through the continent, its perceived benefits gradually widened to include taste and sociability.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 1650, coffeehouses flourished in France and England, where they were popular forums for political and literary debate as well as general conversation.14 In Italy’s leading cities, for example, men and women crowded into simple, low-ceilinged rooms for companionship, news, and gossip. Parisians met at a growing number of cafés, including the Café Procope and the Café de la Régence.15 In London, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, and other public figures were devotees of particular coffeehouses.16 In 1668, Edward Lloyd opened a coffeehouse that attracted merchants involved in overseas trade. He often prepared lists of ships’ schedules and contents for underwriters who met there. The insurance company Lloyd’s of London grew out of this enterprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, imperial expansion took coffee to Indonesia, South America, the Caribbean, and other parts of the world. Coffee probably reached North America in the early 1600s. Its popularity spread, and by 1670, coffee had replaced beer as New York City’s favorite breakfast drink.18 In the late seventeenth century, coffeehouses opened in Boston, New York, and other colonial cities, and these establishments quickly became centers of commercial, political, and social activity.19  North Americans drank increasing amounts of coffee and tea in the eighteenth century, but tea was  probably the preferred beverage for most colonists.20 Coffee, however, got a boost in 1773, when colonists boarded British ships anchored in Boston and pitched tea cargoes overboard in protest of the mother country’s economic policies. The Boston Tea Party led many Americans to reject tea for patriotic reasons. “I must be weaned,” John Adams noted in 1774, “and the sooner the better.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Coffee consumption climbed slowly after the American Revolution, more rapidly in the early 1800s. In 1859, Americans consumed about eight pounds of coffee a year, per capita.22 Many city dwellers enjoyed the drink in coffeehouses. But most men and women, as  the industry historian  Mark Pendergrast noted, “drank coffee at home or brewed it over campfires heading west.”23 In the city or on the frontier, the beverage was generally prepared by boiling grounds in water. Some users added eggs or fish skins to the mixture to clarify it, helping the grounds settle to the bottom. To mask the fishy taste and bitterness of the finished product, many used milk and sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Civil War, coffee became an important staple in Union soldiers’ daily diets. The federal government purchased more than 4 million pounds of coffee, allocating each fighting man up to 36 pounds of beans a year.25 After the war, coffee prices in the United States dropped, and consumption rose significantly. By the 1870s, water and coffee were the most popular nonalcoholic drinks in the United States.
      </p>
      <h4><em>Large Processors</em></h4>
      <p>
        Technological and product innovations spurred more consumption. The 1864 invention of the self- emptying roaster enabled industrious manufacturers such as John Arbuckle of New York City and   Jim Folger of San Francisco to distribute ground coffee on a regional or even national scale.27 In 1878, American manufacturers Caleb Chase and James Sanborn introduced the first canned ground coffee.28 They advertised the Chase & Sanborn product heavily, and consumers responded enthusiastically to its quality and convenience. In 1901, Nashville entrepreneurs Joel Cheek and John Neal went into business to produce Cheek’s special Maxwell House Blend, named for the local hotel  in which it became popular. Six years later, President Theodore Roosevelt, sampling the coffee on a trip through Nashville, proclaimed it “Good to the last drop.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Stimulated by the proliferation of national advertising and chain stores, U.S. coffee consumption flourished in the early twentieth century. In 1939, the average American consumed more than 14 pounds of coffee annually. According to market surveys, 98% of families drank the beverage.30 There were several reasons for the beverage’s popularity, noted one industry observer, including the “big boost” that Prohibition gave coffee drinking, “high-pressure advertising plus cheap retail prices,”    and “the nervous national tempo.” “It may also be,” the same writer reasoned, “that when depression nips an average man’s buying power, he finds a 5¢ cup of coffee a sort of emotional ersatz for more expensive things.”
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of World War II, a handful of large companies led the U.S. coffee industry. Chase & Sanborn, A&P, and Maxwell House together controlled almost 40% of annual revenues. The rest of the market belonged to Folgers, Nestlé, Hills Brothers, and more than a thousand medium-sized and smaller roasters that served local and regional markets.32 The large manufacturers had profited during the war by supplying soldiers with all the coffee they could drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the war ended, U.S. coffee executives were optimistic.34 Despite the growing popularity of soft drinks, particularly Coca-Cola and Pepsi, most industry analysts expected coffee usage to rise.35 And indeed it did, at first. In 1946, the average person consumed almost 20 pounds, which, when brewed, produced approximately 40 gallons of coffee.36 Nearly 75% of the population age 10 and over drank the hot beverage (Exhibit 2).37 The prevalence of coffee in the mid-twentieth century spawned its    own cultural icons and social institutions: the New York or San Francisco café patronized by writers, artists, and musicians; the stark diner depicted in Edward Hopper’s painting Nighthawks; and the coffee break in business and household schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coffee manufacture and cultivation developed in step with the drink’s growing importance. By 1940 food scientists, working with large processors such as Nestlé, had produced instant as well as decaffeinated coffee. Upstream innovation revolved around the commercialization of coffea robusta, a hardy, easily harvested strain of coffee that yielded double the beans per acre of the arabica strain. Robusta beans produced a harsh, bitter taste when brewed, but large manufacturers realized that  they could be mixed with arabica beans to produce lower-cost blends for canned or instant coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regional roasters, many of which relied on arabica beans, proliferated in the postwar period. These suppliers sold their beans and beverages through local grocery stores and other outlets.39 By  the mid-1960s, however, supermarkets had become the dominant distribution channel for coffee. Competition for shelf space forced many small suppliers out of business and spurred consolidation among others.40 Large suppliers, such as General Foods, which owned the Maxwell House, Yuban, Sanka, and Maxim brands, increased their capacity and market share. In 1960, a handful of big companies, including General Foods, Hills Brothers, Folgers, Standard Brands, and A&P, controlled more than half of industry sales.41 Further consolidation followed, and General Foods; Procter & Gamble, which had acquired Folgers in 1963; and Nestlé, which owned the Nescafe, Hills Bros., and MJB names, emerged as the leading players in the U.S. coffee market.
      </p>
      <p>
        To gain market share and supermarket shelf space, the big processors clashed in frequent price wars, using coupons, discounts, and other promotions. As price competition and pressure on profit margins intensified, the major rivals sought ways to cut costs. A few companies started packing   coffee in 14-ounce cans and selling them at prices that previously had applied to one-pound containers. Most began adding larger quantities of cheaper robusta beans to their existing blends. Makers of instant or soluble coffee relied even more heavily on the less expensive beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The large manufacturers invested huge sums in print and television advertising. The vast majority of these messages were targeted at women. Many emphasized the importance of  pleasing  other family members, equating good coffee with domestic harmony and playing on women’s fears and fantasies. For example, a 1962 print ad for Chock Full o’ Nuts showed a woman with a  cup  overturned on her head and coffee spilling down her face. The message: “Men! Don’t let it come to this! Win your fight for a decent cup of coffee without losing your temper!” The tag line at the bottom of the ad proclaimed “every man’s right . . . every wife’s duty.”42 Inaugurated in the mid-1960s, an ambitious series of television commercials for Folgers featured a coffee-brewing busybody named Mrs. Olsen, who berated countless housewives for serving substandard coffee and ruining their husbands’ happiness.43 General Foods ran television commercials that portrayed a husband lecturing his spouse on coffee preparation. “Be a good little Maxwell Housewife,” he said, “and I think I’ll keep you around.”
      </p>
      <p>
        During the 1960s and 1970s, the large roasters competed for shares in a shrinking market. Per capita coffee consumption began to fall in the mid-1960s, declining from a postwar peak of 3.1 cups per day in 1963 to less than two cups in the mid-1980s.44 In 1986, the average American consumed less than two cups of coffee a day, and almost one of every two men, women, and children over the  age of 10 did not drink the beverage at all.45 Long the number one beverage in the United States (excluding tap water), coffee by the early 1990s had dropped to a distant second behind soft drinks.
      </p>
      <h4><em>Specialty Coffee</em></h4>
      <p>
        While the larger coffee business stagnated in the 1970s and 1980s, however, the specialty segment expanded. Unlike Procter & Gamble or the other large manufacturers, specialty coffee producers   were usually small, independent distributors selling only higher-quality arabica beans. In the early 1980s, the retail price of specialty coffee beans averaged $5 to $7 per pound, about twice the price of traditional coffee.46 Despite the higher price, self-appointed enthusiasts around the country had been buying specialty coffee for decades from independent coffeehouses and regional roasters such as Zabar’s in New York City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, these consumers were a tiny minority of U.S. coffee drinkers. Most households in the postwar period had little knowledge of where the coffee that they purchased through supermarkets originated. Most had never tasted an espresso-based  beverage. Most did not own a coffee grinder. The vast majority of Americans spent little time thinking about, preparing, or savoring their coffee. The specialty coffee business, based on interested, educated buyers who cared about quality coffee and how it was served, remained a fragmented niche of the larger market in the 1950s and 1960s.
      </p>
      <p>
        This began to change as growing numbers of coffee aficionados opened their own roasters to sell fresh, full-bodied arabica beans in scattered locations around the country. Some of these men and women followed in the tradition of Alfred Peet, whose passion for and knowledge of fine coffee was well-known among devotees. Peet’s father had been a roaster in the Netherlands, and  Alfred  inherited his interest in quality coffee. After arriving in San Francisco in the 1950s, Peet worked for an importing company that supplied beans to Hills Brothers and Folgers. But he became disillusioned. “I couldn’t understand why in the richest country in the world they were drinking such poor quality coffee,” he said.48 In 1966, he opened his own store in Berkeley to roast and sell whole-bean coffee directly to consumers. Peet, as Howard Schultz later noted, “treated coffee like wine, appraising it in terms of origins and estates and years and harvests.” 49 The Dutch coffee connoisseur also created his own blends and worked to educate consumers about specialty coffee: its origins, flavors, and preparation. His store quickly became a northern California institution, attracting first-time customers and loyal fans alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other coffee lovers got into the business. Inspired by Peet’s work, Gordon Bowker, Jerry Baldwin, and Zev Siegl opened a store in Seattle to roast and sell quality whole beans in early 1971. The store, which was located in Pike’s Place Market near Puget Sound, also offered bulk tea, spices, and  supplies, but it did not sell coffee by the cup. The three partners, in addition to taking the name “Starbucks” from mate Starbuck in the novel Moby Dick, chose a logo based on an old Norse woodcut—a bare-breasted mermaid or siren surrounded by the store’s original name: Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice.50 Its reputation spread. Within 11 years of its founding, the company had 85 employees, five retail stores selling freshly roasted beans (known as whole-bean coffee to distinguish it from traditional canned or instant coffee), a small roasting facility, and a wholesale business that supplied coffee to local restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Denver, San Diego, Pittsburgh, and other cities, independent specialty coffee roasters sprang up. Most of them were small operations without large advertising budgets. But many companies,  such as Peet’s or Starbucks, had an enthusiastic base of regular customers who told their family, friends, and colleagues about gourmet coffee. As was the case with microbreweries and their individual varieties of beer, consumer interest in specialty coffee grew principally by word of mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On both the demand and supply sides, the fledgling specialty coffee market expanded rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s, rising from $45 million in annual revenues in 1969 to more than $750 million in 1980.51 Despite such growth, specialty coffee remained a very small segment, accounting  for less than a tenth of total industry sales in the early 1980s.52 Nestlé, General Foods, and Procter & Gamble, nicknamed “the Big Three,” controlled nearly 60% of roasted coffee and 80% of instant coffee sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1981, however, the specialty coffee business captured the attention and talents of Schultz. He had not worked in the industry, and he had learned to drink coffee that came from a can purchased   in a supermarket. Yet Schultz had a strong hunch that the young, fragmented specialty coffee sector held tremendous opportunities. Many of these were on the demand side, and he intended to seize them: to use his talents to build a strong company and a large market for high-quality coffee.
      </p>
      <h4>Schultz’s Beginnings</h4>
      <p>
        Howard Schultz was born on July 19, 1953 in Brooklyn, the most populous borough of New York City. He was the oldest of three children of Fred and Elaine Schultz, both of whom were from Jewish working-class families. When Howard and his younger brother and sister were growing up, their father held a variety of jobs, working as a cab driver, diaper-service truck driver, and factory laborer. Elaine stayed home to take care of her young children and later took a position as a receptionist. 
        Money was tight in the Schultz household. In 1956, the family moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Bay View Projects, a federally subsidized housing development in Brooklyn’s Canarsie section. “Back then,” Schultz remembered, “the Projects were not a frightening place but a friendly, large leafy compound with a dozen eight-story brick buildings, all brand new.  The  elementary  school, P.S. 272, was right on the grounds of the Projects, complete with playground, basketball courts, and paved schoolyard. Still, no one was proud of living in the Projects; our parents were all what we now call ‘the working poor.’” 
        Howard was a bright, sociable, and energetic child. From an early age, he loved sports, organizing countless pickup games of baseball and basketball among neighborhood friends and competing in larger informal events on the school grounds nearby. “Each Saturday and  Sunday  morning,  hundreds of us kids would gather in the schoolyard,” Schultz recalled. “You had to be good there, because if you didn’t win, you’d be out of the game, forced to watch for hours before you could get back in. So I played to win.” His teammates and opponents came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds: “Jewish kids, Italian kids, black kids. Nobody ever had to lecture us about diversity; we lived it.”
        When he was 12, Howard began earning money as a paperboy. As a teenager, he held a number    of part-time jobs, serving in a Brooklyn luncheonette and working in Manhattan’s garment district. Howard attended Canarsie High School with almost 6,000 other students.57 Academic work did not captivate him, and he applied himself only sporadically to his courses. He directed the bulk of his  time and ambition to playing football, seeing athletics as an escape route out of the projects, out of Brooklyn, away from the road his father had taken.  His diligence paid off when he became quarterback of the high school team. In his senior year, he was offered a football scholarship to the University of Northern Michigan, where he enrolled in the fall of 1971. Howard majored in communications, taking courses in public speaking, business, and other subjects. Nights, weekends, and summers, he worked various jobs to help finance his  education. In 1975, he received a B.S., becoming the first college graduate in his family.  Schultz entered Xerox’s sales training program the next year. After completing the course, he returned to New York and started drumming up prospective business customers for the company’s office equipment, going door to door in midtown Manhattan. It was not easy work. The process, Schultz said, “taught me to think on my feet.” “So many doors slammed on me,”  he added,  “that I had to develop a thick skin and a concise sales pitch for a then-newfangled machine called a word processor.” But the 23-year-old learned quickly, thriving on the competition that permeated professional selling. He enjoyed trying “to be the best, to be noticed, to provide the most leads to my salesmen. I wanted to win,” Schultz said.  He outsold many of his peers and was promoted to a full sales representative. But in 1979, after three years with Xerox, Schultz grew restless and sought a more challenging position. At 26, he took a job with Hammerplast, a U.S. subsidiary of the Swedish housewares company Perstorp. He rose quickly to vice president and general manager of the subsidiary, responsible for U.S. operations and based in New York. With a team of 20 salespeople reporting to him, Schultz sold Hammerplast products to upscale retailers.  By 1981, he had come a long way from the projects. He had an executive job with a large salary. Together with Sheri Kersch, an interior designer whom he had met three years earlier, he owned an apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. “We had a great life,” Schultz remembered, “going to the theater, dining at restaurants, inviting friends to dinner parties. We even rented a summer house in the Hamptons.”
      </p>
      <h4><em>A New Opportunity</em></h4>
      <p>
        But at age 28, he was again restive, on the lookout for new possibilities. In 1981, Schultz decided to visit a small Hammerplast client in Seattle. He had never been to the city and was curious about why this particular customer—Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice—was ordering so many plastic cone filters from the housewares supplier. Schultz knew that the coffee retailer had only four outlets at the time. But it was buying more of the devices than Macy’s department store chain or other big clients.  The trip was Schultz’s first encounter with specialty coffee. His mother had drunk instant coffee when he was a child, and like most Americans in the early 1980s, he had grown up thinking of coffee as a commodity purchased along the inner aisles of supermarkets. In taste, smell, preparation, and overall appeal, Starbucks coffee was markedly different. It was also sold differently—with knowledgeable salespeople scooping coffee beans from bins behind a counter in a store devoted to coffee and tea. Schultz was impressed with the company’s operation, management, and product. “I felt as though I had discovered a whole new continent,” he said. “By comparison, I realized, the   coffee I had been drinking was swill.” Schultz believed that people all over the country would have similar reactions. The product might interest the growing numbers of men and women who embraced natural foods, those that they perceived to be less processed and more nutritious.63 It might also appeal to Americans, especially urban households, who were buying increasing amounts and varieties of ethnic food such as pesto, burritos, hummus, and more.64 These consumers might enjoy Starbucks’ emphasis on a given coffee’s origins and history. Most important from Schultz’s vantage point, coffee drinkers everywhere who were accustomed to traditional blends and percolator brews would like the dark, full taste  of  specialty coffee and would be willing to pay more for it. Starbucks, Schultz told Baldwin and Bowker, had the potential to become a national business with “dozens of stores, maybe even hundreds.” Someday, the enthusiastic New Yorker argued, “the Starbucks name could become synonymous with great coffee—a brand that guaranteed world-class quality.”  He wanted to be part of the retailer’s growth. After many discussions with the managing partners, Schultz joined the company as director of operations and marketing in 1982.66 His new salary was considerably lower than what he had earned at Hammerplast, but he was granted a small equity  stake. In July, he and Sheri Kersch were married. That fall, the couple moved to Seattle, and Schultz started work at Starbucks.  In 1983, Schultz traveled to Milan, Italy on a buying trip for the company. Once there, he was impressed by the centrality of coffee within the national culture. This was evident in the city’s espresso bars, where trained baristas prepared espresso, cappuccino, and other drinks made from high-quality arabica beans. “I saw the relationship,” Schultz explained, “that Italian culture has with coffee and the romance of the beverage. The Italian starts his day at the espresso bar and sees his friends there later on.”67 In the early 1980s, there were 1,500 espresso bars in Milan alone, 20,000 in the country as a whole. “It seemed they were on every street corner, and all were packed,” Schultz observed. He also noticed that although each establishment had its own individual character, all of them provided an inherently social experience—one that offered people community, comfort, and some sense of extended family.  Most Americans in the early 1980s, Schultz realized, had little access to the quality and sociability of coffee as it was served in Italian espresso bars. Even Starbucks, which was founded to roast and  sell first-rate beans, did not provide coffee by the cup. “We treated coffee as produce,” Schultz remembered, “something to be bagged and sent home with the groceries.” He and other company managers had overlooked the important associations that coffee drinking had to conversation and communal rituals. “We stayed one big step away from the heart and soul of what coffee has meant throughout the centuries.”  He saw an enormous opportunity for Starbucks. He envisioned the company re-creating  the Italian coffee bar culture in the United States, using its reputation for fine coffee to serve espresso drinks while providing a comfortable, appealing store experience. Schultz was convinced that such offerings would differentiate the Seattle roaster from the scores of other specialty coffee suppliers entering the American market. When he returned to Seattle, he tried to convince his bosses that Starbucks should build a chain of Italian-style espresso bars. But the managing partners were not interested in entering what they considered the restaurant business.

      <h4><em>His Own Business</em></h4>
      <p>
        Determined to pursue his dream, Schultz left Starbucks in late 1985. He raised $400,000 from private investors, including his former employers, Baldwin and Bowker.71 He planned to use the money to launch his first coffee bar. If the store was successful, he would seek an additional $1.25 million to demonstrate the viability of the concept, opening at least eight more outlets in and outside of Seattle with a view to more growth.  Schultz’s initial store began business on April 8, 1986 in the Columbia Center, a major Seattle office building. Named after the Italian word for newspaper, Il Giornale, the store sold Starbucks coffee in whole beans and in espresso drinks, such as cappuccinos and caffe lattes. Il Giornale also offered salads and panini (sandwiches).  Former Starbucks employees, such as Dawn Pinaud, who had decided to join Schultz in his start- up helped staff the store. So, too, did Dave Olsen, a new partner. Olsen, a native of Montana, had a decade of experience in the specialty coffee business. He ran a well-known Seattle coffeehouse that bought beans from Starbucks. At the time he met Schultz, Olsen was considering his own expansion plans. Specialty coffee, he believed, “needed to be taken out of the intellectual stratosphere and made more accessible.”72 Schultz’s idea for a chain of coffee bars modeled on those in Italy made intuitive and economic sense to Olsen. He agreed to work for Il Giornale at an annual salary of $12,000 plus stock options.  From their first meeting, the two men liked and respected each other.74 Their experiences and talents fit well together. Schultz focused his energies outward: presenting the business concept, raising capital, locating real estate, creating the brand, and preparing for growth. Olsen was the operator: running the café, hiring and training baristas, buying and preparing fine coffee, and “just plain doing whatever was needed in the store.”75 This rough division of responsibility made sense to both partners.  But in the exigencies of managing a brand new business, they could not always adhere to it. “Everyone did everything” in the small company, Olsen said. He sliced meats in the tiny business office while his partner made phone calls at the desk next to him. Schultz waited  on customers,  wiped counters, and checked the speed of service in the store. Baristas, such as Jennifer Ames- Karreman and Pinaud, who managed the store, took part in many decisions. “We agonized over all kinds of questions, big and small, trying to make the coffee bar experience as fine as possible,” Olsen said. “We debated, for example, whether a particular napkin was as good in quality as the coffee we were serving.”76 The entire staff logged long hours.77 “We lived and breathed the company and its possibilities,” Olsen said. But it was not “work-aholism” that drove the group. “It was risk, passion, investment, and opportunity all converging.”  Il Giornale quickly became popular, attracting more than 1,000 customers a day within six months of the store’s opening.79 Schultz and Olsen attributed this success not only to the quality of the coffee the company served but also to the people it hired and trained. Olsen worked with baristas and other employees to teach them about coffee, including its origins, varieties, and preparation. Schultz concentrated on selling techniques. Both partners recognized that building a market for coffee bars required educating consumers, introducing them to and helping them assess specialty coffee. They encouraged Il Giornale’s employees to communicate their knowledge of and enthusiasm for coffee to store patrons.  Throughout 1986, Schultz continued to raise money. He spoke to dozens of people, explaining his plan to transform coffee from a commodity into a branded offering that consumers associated with quality, service, and community. Most were not interested in funding the venture and cited several reasons. Coffee sales were stagnant. Retail establishments, especially restaurants, were often precarious enterprises, particularly vulnerable to poor management and downturns in the business cycle. Many potential backers questioned whether, in the absence of a proprietary  technology,  Schultz could construct a sustainable competitive advantage. Perhaps, some reasoned, high- technology companies were better investments. Of the 242 men and women whom Schultz approached, more than 200 decided not to fund the entrepreneur’s venture.  A number of people, however, did purchase equity in the young company. In this first round of financing, Schultz raised $1.65 million, including $400,000 in seed capital. He earmarked the funds for Il Giornale’s growth, opening a second store in downtown Seattle in late 1986 and a third the next spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. Schultz knew it would be more difficult to  build  brand  loyalty for Il Giornale in distant markets. It would also be harder to source and staff such outlets. But Schultz believed he had no choice. His business plan was based on multiple stores in various regions. He had to show investors that his concept was credible outside Seattle.  Revenues at all three stores grew rapidly. By mid-1987, sales totaled about $1.5 million. The company was not yet profitable. But it was meeting the financial and organizational targets that Schultz and others had set for the business.  In early 1987, Schultz saw an opportunity to expand his business even faster. The two remaining founders of Starbucks (Zev Siegl had sold his interest in the business in 1980) were thinking about selling the Seattle coffee business in order to pursue other opportunities. Bowker wanted to concentrate on a new microbrewery venture, Red Hook Ale. Baldwin had decided to devote his time  to managing Peet’s Coffee & Tea, which Starbucks had acquired in 1984. Schultz learned that he  might be able to acquire Starbucks, including the company’s six retail stores and roasting plant in Seattle and the Starbucks name.  In August 1987, Il Giornale bought the Seattle assets of Starbucks, including its name, for $3.8 million.82 Schultz financed the purchase by selling equity to private investors, most of whom already owned stock in the acquiring business. The entrepreneur and his colleagues decided to call the new organization the Starbucks Corporation, consolidating all the stores under the name.83 The combined enterprise included almost 100 employees, nine outlets located in Seattle and Vancouver, and a roasting plant.  Schultz assumed the position of chief executive officer of the company. Olsen took responsibility for coffee buying and roasting. Lawrence Maltz, an investor in Il Giornale, had run a multimillion- dollar beverage company before joining Starbucks as executive vice president in late 1987.84 Ron Lawrence had extensive restaurant experience when Schultz hired him to handle finance and accounting. He now became controller of the new company. Christine Day, who had started working with Schultz in late 1985, helping him with a myriad of functions from inventory control to sales audits and payroll, continued with the bigger enterprise.

      <h4>Starbucks Expands</h4>
      <p>
        The management team wasted no time in plotting a growth strategy for the company. Schultz’s business plan called for opening 125 stores in five years with annual revenues rising to $60 million—a yearly average of almost $500,000 per store—at the end of the period. Measured by almost any standard, these were very ambitious targets. The average store revenue projections, for example,   were considerably higher than those that the former Starbucks Coffee Company had achieved in 16 years of operation.  But Schultz and his team thought that they had to move quickly. They believed that the potential market for specialty coffee was enormous. In 1987, however, this market was also largely undefined. On the demand side, the majority of consumers knew little about espresso drinks or whole beans.  Few had encountered an Italian-style coffee bar. On the supply side, the vast majority of outlets selling specialty coffee were small, independent purveyors, mostly mom-and-pop coffeehouses or single-store retailers. A few other regional roasters like Starbucks were starting to expand in various areas of the country, opening additional bean stores, mail-order operations, or coffee bars. For example, Chicago-based Gloria Jean’s Coffee Bean, which sold a range of specialty coffees, including flavored beans, had begun franchising some of its operations in 1985. Within two years, the company had 23 stores—eight company owned and 15 franchised—located primarily in malls and targeted at middle-class consumers.  But a clear market leader had not yet emerged. In the late 1980s, none of these companies had developed a widely recognized brand or large nationwide base of loyal customers. None had substantially shaped most consumers’ expectations regarding specialty coffee. No one  single  company influenced the way in which other players in the specialty coffee business competed.  Schultz wanted Starbucks to help make this fledgling market. He was certain that his firm’s offering—a particular retail experience built on premium quality coffee, responsive service, and inviting ambience—had broad appeal. To exploit this appeal, he and his colleagues would have to make the Starbucks experience available to millions of consumers. This, in turn, meant identifying and reaching households in specific areas all over the country, exposing them to the brand and its distinctive benefits, introducing them to new beverages and beans, and helping them associate Starbucks with fine coffee and sociability. Schultz and his team intended to do this before potential competitors—such as other specialty roasters, large food processors, or restaurant chains—did. In the context of these strategic goals, speed was essential.  By late 1988, Schultz and his team had opened 15 new company-owned stores. Most of these outlets were concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, in cities such as Seattle, Vancouver, and Portland, Oregon. Each of the northwestern cities had a strong existing coffee culture, sustained by coffeehouses and roasters, such as Starbucks and Seattle-based Torrefazione Italia. Consumers in these areas already bought coffee beans and specialty coffee drinks from local stores. Schultz, Olsen, and others intended to capitalize on this regional interest and on Starbucks’ strong reputation in attracting customers to the company’s espresso bars. “Our strategy,” Schultz explained, “was to gain   a foothold in each market and create a strong presence there before we moved to another city.”  The single exception to this plan was Schultz’s decision to expand into Chicago. In October 1987, Starbucks opened a store in the center of the Midwestern city, about a block from the Sears Tower. It was the company’s first venture outside the Pacific Northwest, and it presented several key  challenges. The company would have to create an infrastructure capable of supporting expansion 2,000 miles away. Starbucks would also have to hire and train employees who had never heard of the company and were unfamiliar with specialty coffee more generally. The business would face higher costs for rent, utilities, and other inputs than in western markets. Finally, Chicago consumers had little previous experience with specialty coffee. Even Schultz, who was committed to the move, wondered, “How could we guarantee the appeal of top-quality coffee in the heartland of Folgers and Maxwell House?”  Despite these potential obstacles, the entrepreneur decided to proceed. He was determined to test the feasibility of a national chain of coffee bars outside Seattle, or “Latte Land,” as some visitors dubbed the city.88 During the next two years, the company opened additional outlets in Chicago. Many  of  the  problems  that  Schultz  and  his  advisers  had  foreseen  did,  in  fact,  materialize.  The company lost tens of thousands of dollars in its first years of Midwestern operations.89 Senior managers wondered “how far the business concept would travel.”  In the face of these questions, the entrepreneur and his colleagues continued to pursue an aggressive expansion plan, concentrating on western markets. Three years after Schultz acquired Starbucks, the company had 75 retail stores.  In 1988, the business issued its first mail-order catalogue, targeting the publication at consumers in specific cities. Within a year, Starbucks was sending its catalogue to customers in all 50 states.92 This distribution channel helped build brand awareness in regions where the company did not have stores. It also helped executives understand the emerging demand for specialty coffee: where it was growing quickly, where it was expanding more slowly, and where it was stagnant. This information was useful not only in trying to increase the company’s mail-order business but also in selecting potential sites for new cafés. Since catalogue buyers “had to make a special effort to obtain our  coffee,” Schultz explained, they “were often the most loyal customers, and it made sense to open stores in cities and neighborhoods where they were clustered.”  Wholesale distribution also served to enhance consumer awareness. Since 1988, Starbucks’ specialty sales division had sold coffee to restaurants and other institutional purchasers located primarily in the Pacific Northwest. This line of business grew quickly as Starbucks expanded into   new markets. By 1990, specialty sales revenues amounted to $4.5 million, climbing to over $9 million two years later.94 In the early 1990s, Starbucks secured several important accounts, including Horizon Air (a subsidiary of Alaskan Airlines) and Nordstrom, the upscale department store chain. Powered  by increasing revenues in all its distribution channels, Starbucks sales climbed more than threefold in the company’s initial years, from $10.2 million in 1988 to over $35 million in 1990 (Exhibit 5).

      <h4><em>Recruiting Leadership</em></h4>
      <p>
        Despite growing sales, losses also mounted as the business spent ahead of what it took in. The  bulk of these expenditures was devoted to constructing an organizational infrastructure: to hiring seasoned executives for the company’s retail, financial, human resources, and marketing functions; to constructing a much larger roasting facility; and to putting sophisticated management information systems in place. Schultz and other managers were convinced that the enterprise needed to make  such investments proactively, creating and marshaling resources that exceeded current needs in anticipation of future imperatives. In these early years, Schultz remembered, “We laid a solid base for national expansion.” “It was expensive,” he continued, “but without it, we would never have been   able to accelerate our growth year after year, without stopping to catch our breath.”  Some of the most important investments that the company made were in management talent. In 1989, for example, Howard Behar, a retail veteran with 25 years’ experience, joined the company to oversee store operations. He immediately set about identifying organizational weaknesses and trying to correct them. He argued, for instance, that Starbucks was too product focused, that the business needed to pay more attention to the people who make, serve, and buy coffee. Since baristas and other employees directly affected the quality of products and the consumer experience in stores, Behar  said, they exerted tremendous influence on the company’s performance. Committed, enthusiastic employees were much more likely to deliver good service and provide an appealing environment for customers than disenfranchised staff. The success of the business thus depended significantly on motivating and sustaining employees’ interest in Starbucks’ offerings, including its  products,  working environment, and culture.  It also rested, Behar contended, on consistent attention to consumer priorities. He urged store workers to listen to and grant buyers’ requests, instituting a “Just Say Yes” campaign  for  all Starbucks outlets. The retailer began distributing free-drink certificates to disgruntled buyers. Employees gave stickers to children. If a consumer brought another brand of whole-bean coffee into a Starbucks store, baristas ground it. “As long as it is moral, legal, and ethical,” Behar said, “we should do whatever it takes to please the customer.”  In 1990, the company made another important appointment, hiring Orin Smith as chief financial officer (CFO). Like Behar, he was about 10 years older than Schultz. Smith had been budget director for the state of Washington, a managing partner at the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche, and CFO for a freight company before joining Starbucks. He had considerable experience managing complex enterprises, which Schultz hoped to exploit as the company grew. Forging a large market  for  specialty coffee, a meaningful brand, and an effective organization, the entrepreneur recognized, would require more than his own entrepreneurial inspiration and commercial imagination. “Many business visionaries,” he said, “have failed as leaders because they could not execute. Processes and systems, discipline and efficiency are needed to create a foundation before creative ideas can be implemented and entrepreneurial vision can be realized.”  Schultz realized he alone did not have the skills to build such an infrastructure. But Smith, he thought, did, and he granted the CFO wide-ranging authority to accomplish this objective.100 During the next five years, Smith recruited talented professional managers from Taco Bell, Wendy’s, and other retailers. Some of these individuals, like Deidra Wager, who joined Starbucks in the early 1990s to help oversee retail operations, relinquished high-powered positions and executive perks to join the young business. “It was not easy to give up what I had learned and built at PepsiCo,” she said. “The salary was lower at Starbucks, and there was no company car. But I was an early adopter of cappuccinos, and I thought many other consumers would respond similarly.” She was struck by the entrepreneurial vision behind the organization. “I believed strongly in Schultz’s dream and the powerful emotional connection that is possible between customers, partners [Starbucks employees], and a daily cup of coffee.”101 Like most of Schultz’s early executive hires, Wager stayed with the company, taking on increasing responsibility as the organization grew.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Schultz and his young team worked to develop a range of systems—financial, accounting, legal, planning, and logistics—that the company would require if it were to become a national business. Achieving this goal was hardly a sure bet in 1990. Starbucks lost money in fiscal 1987, 1988, and 1989—more than $1.1 million in 1989 alone.102 But investors, impressed by the company’s increasing sales and the expansion of the larger specialty coffee market, which was growing at more than 20% a year, continued to support Schultz and his organization.103 Between 1988 and 1991, the entrepreneur raised $32 million in three rounds of private financing. Most of these funds were supplied by venture capitalists, with individual investors buying almost $4 million in Starbucks’ equity. Growth continued to accelerate. In 1991, the company entered the southern California market, opening kiosks in Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and West Los Angeles, followed by freestanding stores    in Santa Monica, Brentwood, and Los Angeles. Starbucks was immediately popular in Los Angeles.   In late 1990, the Los Angeles Times had named Starbucks coffee the best in America, fueling broad interest in the company and its products.105 As in other markets, the company did not advertise its new locations heavily, relying instead on consumers’ own endorsements to family, friends, or colleagues to promote the brand. Word of mouth spread quickly, and lines formed outside stores in Santa Monica and other locations. Hollywood notables, such as director David Lynch and singer  Paula Abdul, frequented company outlets.106 “Almost overnight, Starbucks became chic,” Schultz recalled.  The early 1990s were a turning point for the firm. In Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and other cities, large numbers of consumers started drinking Starbucks coffee on a regular basis.108 The markets that the company had been trying to build by opening stores and educating customers in all these places took off, attaining new, sustained momentum. “One day it seemed,” Smith said, “a  critical mass of customers discovered Starbucks and stayed with the company.” “We had been working for a long time,” he continued, “to interest people in our products and retail experience by relying on consumer word of mouth. This is a powerful, enduring way to create loyalty. But we did  not know exactly when it would bear fruit. Then virtually overnight, it just popped.”  Revenues boomed. Between fiscal 1990 and 1992, Starbucks’ sales increased almost 300%, to $103 million (Exhibit 5). Earnings turned positive in 1990, climbing steeply to $4.4 million in 1992.110 In July 1992, after several years of sound performance, the company conducted an initial public offering (IPO) of 1.5 million shares of common stock to raise funds for such development. Issued at $17 a share, the IPO yielded $29 million in net proceeds.111 By late 1992, Starbucks had 154 outlets, employed more than 2,000 people, and was one of the most widely recognized companies in the young specialty coffee industry.

      <h4><em>A Growing Market</em></h4>
      <p>
        Other purveyors also tried to build a presence in this young market. One of the largest companies was Gloria Jean’s Coffee Beans, which in 1993 had 163 outlets in 33 states.113 Most of them were franchised operations located in shopping malls. The majority of other large coffee bar companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s also sold franchises as a way of quickly increasing their market presence.114 Based in Orlando, Barnie’s had 85 outlets in the southeastern United States. Second Cup, a fast-growing Canadian chain, had over 200 stores in the early 1990s. Another Canadian company, Timothy’s, also sold franchises. Smaller regional players in the United States, such as Java Centrale, which had stores in California and  Nevada,  expanded through a combination of company-owned  and franchised cafés.  As Starbucks, Gloria Jean’s, and other retailers expanded into different regions of the country, the broader market grew. In 1990, for example, consumers bought $1 billion in specialty coffee, a 25% increase from the previous year.116 Most of these purchases were beans or ground coffee, which households prepared at home. But as more and more Americans sampled espresso-based beverages, such as caffe lattes or cappuccinos, sales of ready-to-drink coffee skyrocketed, rising almost 3,000% in the early 1990s (Exhibit 3).  Demand-side developments also increased the appeal of specialty coffee. One of the most important was the rising influence of “baby boomers” in a wide range of consumer product and service markets. Almost 78 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964, which was a period of unprecedented economic growth for the United States (Exhibit 4).118 Compared to their parents, “boomers” had more education, higher incomes, and a lower incidence of poverty among their ranks. For example, more than a quarter of boomers earned college degrees. More than 75% held paying jobs, earning a median income of $43,000. Almost two-thirds owned their own home. About 10% of the cohort lived below the poverty line, a smaller fraction than that in the general population.  Affluence molded these Americans’ expectations and objectives. Sociological surveys, market research, and other polls revealed that most boomers grew into adulthood believing that their economic future was secure. They thus felt free, as two demographic experts noted, “to focus instead on themselves, on experimentation, on fulfillment,” on what the sociologist and former political activist Todd Gitlin termed “the voyage to the interior.”120 Relative to older cohorts, boomers were very interested in using consumption to assert their own agency and individuality.  As the first wave of boomers entered their peak income-earning years in the 1980s, many began purchasing more natural foods such as free-range chickens, preservative-free cereals, and bulk grains. They also bought foods that they regarded as higher quality than most processed foods. In embracing products such as arabica coffee beans, freshly baked bread, and organic vegetables, consumers were, Schultz reasoned, rejecting “the artificial for the authentic, the processed for the natural, the mediocre for the high quality.”122 Consumers associated these foods with different benefits, including healthier lifestyles, personal control, better taste, and self-definition. The perceived benefits of more natural foods often came at a price. Organic fruits, like hormone-free poultry and arabica coffee beans, generally cost more than their traditional counterparts.  But for growing numbers of baby boomers, especially those with relatively high levels  of  education and income, the advantages of natural foods justified their higher price tags. Fueled by consumers’ interest and spending power, sales of organic produce and other less-processed, high- quality products increased quickly—as much as 20% a year—in the 1980s and early 1990s.123 Older and younger Americans followed the boomers’ lead, helping create mass demand for goods once    sold in small, niche segments and spurring the rise of dedicated retailers—natural foods  supermarkets such as Whole Foods Markets and Wild Oats and specialty coffee distributors such as Starbucks.  Rising real incomes provided the means for millions of Americans to buy these and other consumer goods. In the last two decades of the twentieth century, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased almost twofold, with per capita income rising more gradually—about 50% (Exhibit 4).125  Not all Americans, however, shared equally in this economic expansion. Mounting evidence  suggested that families in the top fifth of the nation’s income distribution, especially those earning  the largest amounts, gained disproportionately, while the fraction of income going to the remaining 80% of families fell. For example, the average income earned by the top 5% of households grew  almost 40% in real terms between 1979 and 1994, to over $180,000 a year. 126 By contrast, households in the middle fifth of the distribution—the group that has traditionally been at the center of American conceptions of “middle class”—saw their real annual incomes decline slightly to an average of $32,385.  As the richest Americans grew richer in the 1980s and 1990s, they spent lavishly on large houses, luxury cars, fine wines, even private jets. Lower down the economic ladder, other consumers hustled to emulate those on the very top rungs, buying bigger houses, higher-priced cars and sports utility vehicles, more private education, and more professional services than earlier generations had. Many families that could not afford a new home or auto purchased other goods that reflected their aspirations to join the ranks of the wealthiest households: cell phones, Jacuzzis, Caribbean cruises, designer clothes, a third television.128 Home computers, health club memberships, a second car, and other goods that had been considered luxuries by large numbers of consumers in the late 1970s became necessities for millions of households by the mid-1990s.  In order to pay for such goods, most middle- and lower-income Americans saved less.130 They   also borrowed more. All but the highest-income earners took on bigger credit-card obligations. Between 1990 and 1996, total credit-card debt in the United States doubled, climbing to $900 billion. By the end of the century, the average household owed $9,000 on credit-card loans and was paying about $1,000 annually in interest payments on this sum.  Yet not all emulative spending required long-term financing. By the mid-1990s, specialty coffee was one of an increasing number of goods that Americans regarded as “affordable luxuries.”132 Like premium cigars, prestige cosmetics, and other items once purchased primarily by  affluent households, specialty coffee became more important for millions of middle- and lower-middle-class consumers. Starbucks stores, as Schultz realized, attracted policemen and taxi drivers, as well as  surgeons and stockbrokers. Not all customers could afford a luxury car, but each “could order the same $2.00 cappuccino. They’re both giving themselves a reward and enjoying something world class.”   Increasing international travel also fed the specialty coffee market. In 1970, about 14 million Americans a year visited other countries. By 1980, this number had climbed to 22 million, by 1985, more than 34 million, and in 1997, 52 million.134 Many of these people returned home with new interests in the cultures and products that they had sampled abroad, including soccer, samba music, and cappuccino.  Specialty coffee sales soared in the late 1980s and early 1990s, climbing to more than $1.2 billion annually in the United States in 1993 (Exhibit 3).135 The bulk of these revenues were generated in a growing number of coffee bars, cafés, carts, and roaster-retailers. In 1993, there were more than 4,500 such outlets selling dark-roast coffee beans, espresso drinks, and related food and  beverages,  a sixfold increase from 1979.

      <h4>Taking the Brand National</h4>
      <h4><em>Human Resources</em></h4>
      <p>
        By the early 1990s, Starbucks had emerged as one of the leading specialty coffee purveyors in the country. Schultz, Smith, Behar, and other executives believed that the company’s success was predicated on several organizational assets. The most important of these, from senior management’s perspective, was Starbucks’ relationship with its employees. Schultz had long been concerned with what a given organization owed its workforce. Some of this interest was personal. Growing up in Canarsie, he had vowed that if he acquired significant responsibility, he would “do something that would guarantee that people would not be left behind.” “I always wanted,” he continued, “to build    the kind of company that my father never got a chance to work for.”137 But Schultz’s commitment to building an organization that rewarded and respected employees also had an important strategic component: It’s an ironic fact that, while retail and restaurant businesses live or die on customer service, their employees have among the lowest pay and worst benefits of any industry. These people are not only the heart and soul but also the public face of the company. Every dollar earned passes through their hands. In a store or restaurant, the customer’s experience is vital. One bad encounter, and you’ve lost a customer for life.  The entrepreneur resolved to create a different kind of environment at Starbucks. He proposed offering health-care coverage to all employees who worked 20 hours or more a week. Board members were initially critical of the plan, citing its high costs and the company’s mounting financial losses.  But Schultz was convinced that this was a smart investment in Starbucks’ identity, company culture, and future profitability. Paying better benefits helped build competitive advantage, he argued, by attracting strong, committed candidates. Once hired, these people would be well compensated and appreciated. They were more likely to offer responsive service than weaker candidates or disgruntled employees. Competent, enthusiastic workers were also likely to remain with the company longer. Greater worker retention, in turn, helped create a productive organizational culture. It also generally resulted in superior service to consumers, enhancing Starbucks’ relationships with consumers and its brand. “Some of our customers are such regulars,” Schultz explained, “that the minute they walk into the store, a barista recalls their favorite drink. If that barista leaves, that strong connection is broken.”  Lower employee turnover also reduced the company’s training costs. In the late 1980s, Starbucks spent about $3,000 to train each new retail hire. By contrast, providing each worker with full health benefits cost $1,500.140 Based on this evidence and reasoning, the company’s board approved Schultz’s plan, and in late 1988, Starbucks began offering health benefits to employees—or “partners” as they were known within the organization—who worked 20 hours a week or more. Three years later, when a companywide survey revealed that many workers aspired to own a stake in the business, Starbucks instituted an employee stock option plan called Bean Stock.141 Schultz regarded this policy, like the health-benefits plan, as an investment both in the organization’s relationship with consumers and in its culture. “No one can afford to not provide these kinds of benefits,” he said. “The desire to scrimp on these essentials helps reinforce the sense of mediocrity that seeps into many companies. Without them, people don’t feel financially or spiritually tied to their jobs.”  To increase communication between management and employees, Behar initiated open forums at which company news and regional issues were discussed. At these meetings, which were held four times each year, employees were encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions, relay customer feedback, or air grievances. Senior executives regarded these company forums, like Starbucks’ stock option plan or employee health benefits, an important part of Starbucks’ brand creation and retail strategies designed to encourage employee enthusiasm, reduce training costs, and improve service.  By the mid-1990s, the coffee company’s turnover rate was about 60%, compared with rates of 140% to 300% for hourly workers in the fast-food industry.143 The company’s workforce grew quickly in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Exhibit 7).  Starbucks continued to invest in human resources, developing training programs for baristas and managers. Beginning in the late 1980s, all employees were required to complete a 25-hour training program, in which they studied the history of coffee, product offerings, customer service, and the mechanics of beverage preparation. By the mid-1990s, this program, which ran over three different days, included five different subjects, ranging from “Brewing the Perfect  Cup”  to  “Coffee  Knowledge” to “Retail Skills.” Senior executives regarded training and other human resource programs as strategic commitments—critical components of the organization’s identity and culture.

      <h4><em>Quality Control</em></h4>
      <p>
        From senior management’s perspective, the quality of coffee products was critical to the brand’s strength. Unlike many competing chains that relied on wholesalers, Starbucks bought its own coffee direct from producing countries. Olsen, senior vice president of coffee in the mid-1990s, and his team traveled around the world to select beans. “We could operate from a home base,” he explained:  In a great many coffee companies, especially historically, the buyer sat in an office and waited for the samples to arrive, by telex or Morse Code or whatever. A lot of coffee was   bought by description. That kind of thing is still possible, although now it’s augmented greatly by better communication. . . . But we take the whole process one big step further by insisting that we go to places and see for ourselves the circumstances that prevail. We want to learn about the problems and possibilities of growing coffee around the world. We don’t generally buy coffee directly off the farm, but we want to meet the people who cultivate coffee and develop relationships with them. . . . This knowledge helps us understand what to plan for,   and what to expect. This is true whether the coffee is fairly close by in Latin America or  whether it’s in Indonesia or East Africa.  After purchase, the beans were roasted and blended by trained personnel in Starbucks’ facilities, according to specific standards.145 They were then shipped to company stores or wholesale customers in FlavorLock bags, specially designed to preserve freshness without allowing moisture or  air in.  Once a bag was opened in a Starbucks outlet, company policy dictated that the coffee beans must be used within seven days or donated to charity. By controlling as much of the value chain as possible— from buying the raw beans to the roasting process to selling specialty coffee in company-owned stores—Starbucks executives ensured high-quality standards for its offerings in a young market.  For similar reasons, the company consistently refused to franchise. In the early 1990s, Schultz recognized that franchising was a logical way to finance swift growth. Most of the company’s rivals, such as Gloria Jean’s, used this structure to expand. But the entrepreneur was strongly opposed to it. He and his colleagues feared losing control of the resources and initiatives that constituted the developing Starbucks identity. Smith explained:  This company is primarily about building a brand. Everything we do has an effect on the brand. . . . Certainly visual things have an initial impact and have to communicate  pretty clearly the image we want to project. The quality of our products and the service levels we provide and the focus of our efforts are all crucially important in developing who and what    this company is. . . . What we do with our people is another part of it. . . . How can we maintain such standards, the culture we have established in our Seattle markets, as we roll out stores rapidly in new markets? . . . We’ve developed and are continuing to build an infrastructure to meet these challenges. . . . Franchising makes growth far easier because you don’t have to develop the infrastructure and your franchisees share the burden of recruiting and training people. But we decided that this was at the cost of maintaining control of the factors we saw as important.  To meet its growth targets and maintain quality standards, Starbucks built an in-house team of real estate managers, architects, designers, and construction managers. Schultz recruited Arthur Rubinfeld, an architect and commercial real estate broker, to manage this effort. He set high standards for the development and construction of company stores. The objective was to ensure that the design of each space, including layout, lighting, and furnishings, reinforced Starbucks’ commitment to fine coffee products. Rubinfeld was also responsible for building strong relationships with real estate representatives across the country who were experts in their regions and who would facilitate Starbucks’ entry into new markets by helping identify the best locations early on.  In each city that the coffee purveyor entered, site selection was closely linked to the young brand. “We want to be in highly visible locations,” Rubinfeld said in 1995, “that provide easy access for our customers who value great coffee.” “You want a store,” he added, “located in the path of people’s   daily shopping experience, their route to work, or their way home from a movie. You want to be America’s front porch, the place where people gather to meet neighbors and friends.”148 Other significant criteria in choosing new store sites included population density, residents’ median age   and education level, estimated household income, and the state of local competition. “In some sense, we are cherry-picking all markets we go into,” Smith noted in the mid-1990s. “[We’re doing this] by going to highly visible areas and then working our way out as we build brand equity and general awareness.”149 In heavily congested downtown districts that drew substantial weekday traffic, Starbucks opened kiosks, often in commercial buildings.

      <h4><em>Continued Growth</em></h4>
      <p>
        In the mid-1990s, company executives remained committed to rapid expansion. By opening Starbucks stores in new and existing markets, they hoped to increase sales, expand brand awareness, and preempt potential competitors. During most of the 1990s, Starbucks continued to launch outlets at breakneck speed. In 1990, for example, the company had 75 outlets, two years later it had 154, and in 1995, 676.150 By the end of the decade, the retailer averaged almost two store openings a day.151 Most of these new outlets were company-owned cafés and kiosks, with licensed airport sites making up the remainder (Exhibit 8).  During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company concentrated its expansion efforts in the Pacific Northwest and California; the Chicago stores were the retailer’s only outlets not located on the West Coast. Beginning in 1993, however, Starbucks broadened the geographic scope of its customer base, moving into its first East Coast market, Washington, D.C. In 1994, the company entered the Boston market by acquiring The Coffee Connection, a popular local coffee bar chain; during the next two years, Starbucks converted these stores to its own cafés.152 Starbucks also opened new stores in Boston, Minneapolis, New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston in fiscal 1994. The next year, Starbucks established a presence in seven new cities: Baltimore, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, Austin, and San Antonio.  When entering a new region, Starbucks typically opened in a major market that would also function as a logistical and managerial “hub” for further expansion. Chicago served as a hub for the Midwest, while New York City and Boston played the same roles in the Northeast.153 Atlanta was a regional hub for Starbucks’ southeastern growth. Once the hub had been established and management talent recruited to oversee regional and individual store operations, the company rolled out stores in nearby markets.  A significant component of the company’s retail expansion strategy was store clustering.  To  attract consumer attention, lock up market share, and deter other coffee retailers from entering important markets such as DuPont Circle in Washington, D.C., Starbucks opened several stores in very close proximity to one another. In a fashionable area of downtown Vancouver, for example, Starbucks had stores on two of the corners at the intersection of Robson and Thurlow streets. By 1998, there were three company-owned cafés located in and around Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Clustering in high-traffic areas helped increase sales and consumer awareness of the brand but often at the cost of cannibalizing existing business. The growth of comparable store sales, which measured revenues at stores in operation a year or longer, frequently slowed as Starbucks saturated the markets in which it operated, occasionally depressing analysts’ expectations and thus the company’s stock price. Senior managers recognized this possibility but believed that the strategic advantages of store clustering outweighed its potential drawbacks.  As the number of outlets increased, Starbucks’ sales exploded. Total sales surpassed $100 million for the first time in 1992. Four years later, they climbed to almost $700 million, a compound annual growth rate of 61%. Net earnings also rose during the period, to more than $42 million in 1996 (Exhibit 5).

      <h4><em>A "Coffee Experience"</em></h4>
      <p>
        By the close of 1996, Starbucks was the most widely recognized brand of specialty coffee in the United States. Schultz and his colleagues remained convinced that retail stores were essential to the company’s identity and success. Nominally, Starbucks was a coffee retailer. But executives believed that what the company actually provided was a consistent, satisfying “coffee experience” that combined  premium  coffee  beverages  with  an  inviting  atmosphere  and  service  that demonstrated respect for the individual. Since the mid-1980s, Schultz had been certain there was a need for such an environment:  Across all channels of American society and culture, there is such a fracturing of values. There are no heroes. . . . There is little trust in a number of public institutions. . . . I am not saying Starbucks is going to save the world, because we can’t. . . . What we’ve done is provide    a safe harbor for people to go. I think the brand equity of the name Starbucks has supplied a level of trust and confidence, not only in the product, in the trademark, but in the experience of what Starbucks is about. At a time when there are very few things that people have faith in. It’s a very fragile thing. You can’t take it for granted. It’s something that has to be respected and continually built upon.  One of the company’s major strategic objectives focused on maintaining and enhancing the customer’s retail encounter. “In the longer run,” Smith said, “it is what distinguishes us to our customer. . . . The most enduring competitive advantage we have is that we are able to give our customers a better experience at store level . . . than any competitor we have out there.”156 This experience included not only what the coffee customers drank, the interactions they had with store employees, and the visual environment they confronted; it also encompassed the coffee aromas in the air, background music, and overall ambience of company stores.  Strong store operations increased business in other distribution channels, such as Starbucks’ specialty sales and mail-order divisions. In this context, executives believed that Starbucks outlets functioned as “brand validators” or company “billboards,” augmenting and reinforcing  the  company’s image as a premium purveyor of specialty coffee, related products, and an attractive experience.157 “We don’t devote huge sums to large-scale ad campaigns,” observed Jennifer Tisdel, who oversaw retail marketing in the mid-1990s. “Our most important advertising vehicles, our key resources, have been our stores and our people. Consumers go through many retailers in the course  of a week or month. Fortunately, they visit us frequently during these periods. So our in-store communication has to be fresh. Our partners need to be well-informed and enthusiastic in interacting with our customers.”  By the mid-1990s, Starbucks had become a recognized “third place”—a location apart from home or work, where people congregated for social interaction, refreshment, or a few moments of communal solitude.159 In hundreds of cities and towns, company cafés became informal gathering places for mothers and young children, students, teenagers, shoppers, and couples. In 1995, for example, more than 3 million people visited a Starbucks store each week.  Starbucks stores also became meeting places for businesspeople. Spurred on by improved communication technologies, organizational restructuring, expanded entrepreneurial opportunities, and changing family commitments, growing numbers of white-collar Americans started working outside the traditional office in the late 1980s and 1990s. By the end of the twentieth century, 18 million men and women used their home as their primary place of business, a 400% increase from 1990.161 For telecommuters and others seeking a setting outside company offices, Starbucks stores offered accessible, well-lit venues for meetings, phone calls, and professional companionship.  As consumer familiarity with the Starbucks experience grew, the company’s offerings spawned a new vocabulary of coffee. Caffe latte, espresso macchiato, and cappuccino had long been common terms in Italy. But the growing popularity of specialty coffees helped make these and other made-to- order beverages, such as double skinny latte (two shots of espresso with steamed low-fat milk), decaf cappuccino (decaffeinated espresso with steamed and foamed milk), and espresso macchiato (espresso with a dollop of milk foam), part of everyday parlance. Once considered an exotic request, ordering a cappuccino or other specialty coffee beverage became commonplace at restaurants, company cafeterias, and airport carts.

      <h4><em>Leveraging the Brand</em></h4>
      <p>
        As Starbucks’ identity developed, Schultz and his senior management team confronted numerous brand-extension possibilities. This company could “put its name on toothpaste and it would sell,” he observed. “But we would never do anything to dilute the integrity of the brand.”162  Executives  debated how to use and enhance the power of the retailer’s reputation without damaging its appeal   to consumers.  In the mid-1990s, Starbucks introduced a number of new products, including a coffee named Blue Note Blend. The blend was the core of a marketing campaign that also featured jazz CDs, specially produced with Capitol Records Inc. and its Blue Note record label. Schultz was confident that music was “a major part of both the environment and the soul of the Starbucks retail experience.”163 The company continued to sell a limited number of CDs in its stores, many of them produced in response to customers’ requests for music that they heard playing in Starbucks stores.  In 1995, the company launched Frappucino, a sweet, cold, creamy drink combining coffee, milk, and ice. Consumer word of mouth about the beverage spread quickly, and Frappucino sold very well around the country. In its first full year on the market, the beverage accounted for $52 million in revenues or about 7% of the company’s total.165 Two years later, the company introduced Power Frappuccino® blended coffee drink, which included protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins and was targeted at health-conscious consumers. Through a joint venture with Pepsi-Cola, Starbucks also began selling a bottled version of Frappuccino® in U.S. supermarkets. By 1998, bottled Frappuccino was the most popular ready-to-drink coffee in the United States.  The company continued to expand its beverage menu, and in 1998, Starbucks introduced several milder-tasting coffee blends, which were marketed under the Milder Dimensions™ label. The retailer also broadened its other drink offerings, introducing Tiazzi™ in 1998, a cold drink  available  in mango citrus and wild berry flavors aimed at consumers who did not drink coffee and those  interested in a lighter beverage during the summer months. During the late 1990s, Starbucks also introduced Caramel Frappuccino®, a blended coffee drink; Chai Tea Latte, a combination of black tea, spices, honey, and milk; Caramel Apple Cider; and White Chocolate Mocha.  Schultz, Smith, and their colleagues also broadened their product offerings beyond beverages and related food sold in company-owned stores. In 1995, they decided to partner with Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream Company to produce premium coffee-flavored ice cream. Made with Starbucks coffee and distributed under the Starbucks name in a variety of flavors, the product innovation served several strategic goals for the coffee retailer. It introduced the Starbucks brand into supermarkets, enabling the company to pique awareness and potentially trial and repeat purchase among millions of consumers who had not previously visited a Starbucks café. Ice cream also allowed the coffee retailer to leverage its strong reputation across a related product. Consumers who trusted the Starbucks brand, associating it with quality coffee, were likely to sample ice cream produced under the same name. Finally, the launch of Starbucks ice cream was part of an ongoing organizational commitment to innovation. “Innovation is a critical part of our business,” according to Smith. “We depend on a pipeline of ideas—including products, concepts, themes—to keep our customers interested and intrigued.”167 The new ice cream was immediately popular and remained so. By the late 1990s, it was the best-selling branded coffee ice cream in the country.  Ice cream was not the only product Starbucks offered outside its own stores. Although the vast majority of the company’s sales continued to be generated in its retail outlets, by the end of the 1990s, the specialty sales division accounted for about 15% of total business.168 Equally important, specialty sales agreements provided alternative distribution channels for the coffee retailer’s products, helping build consumer interest outside the retail stores. For example, millions of Americans who shopped at Barnes & Noble bookstores or Nordstrom department stores encountered Starbucks beverages in small cafés located within these larger outlets. Passengers on Horizon Air and—after  1996—on  United Airlines sampled Starbucks coffee in the air. “We want to expand our brand franchise,” explained Vincent Eades, head of Starbucks’ specialty sales division in 1998, “to be where consumers work, travel, relax, and to help increase our customer base as the overall market develops.”  One of the most important channels for reaching coffee consumers, as Starbucks senior executives realized, was supermarkets. In 1998, supermarkets and food stores accounted for almost half of total coffee sales in the United States.170 With more than 26,000 stores in operation, grocery chains offered the possibility of much greater market penetration than Starbucks could achieve through its own retail and specialty sales operations, allowing the company to reach thousands—perhaps millions—   of additional consumers. Selling through supermarkets also held out the possibility of increasing traffic in Starbucks stores and strengthening the company’s retail franchise.  But supermarket distribution also carried significant risks for the young brand. Starbucks had built its distinctive reputation around the retail experience in company-owned stores. Schultz, Smith, and other executives wondered how new customers would perceive the brand  when  they encountered it in a grocery store aisle—an environment and channel that Starbucks did not control. A second risk involved at-home coffee preparation. Rigorous quality controls and skilled baristas ensured the quality of Starbucks offerings in company-owned stores. Would first-time customers   who bought the company’s beans in grocery stores blame burned or weak-tasting coffee on the Starbucks brand? Finally, how would Starbucks fare against other, much bigger companies  competing in the center aisles of U.S. supermarkets? “Without a doubt,” Smith said, “this is the most formidable competition we have faced. You cannot get much tougher than Kraft, Procter & Gamble, and Nestlé.”  Despite these risks, Starbucks began test-marketing coffee-bean sales in selected grocery stores in 1997. The results were strongly positive, and later that year, Starbucks began selling its beans in specific grocery store chains. In 1998, the coffee company entered a long-term licensing agreement with Kraft to accelerate the growth of the Starbucks brand into the grocery channel. Under the terms of the agreement, Kraft managed all distribution, marketing, and promotions for Starbucks whole- bean and ground coffee in grocery, warehouse club, and mass-merchandise stores. In return, Starbucks sold Kraft the packaged products, receiving licensing fees as a percentage of sales. By late 1999, Starbucks beans and ground coffee were available in 8,500 supermarkets in 15 states.

      <h4>International Expansion</h4>
      <p>
        As Starbucks’ market position in the United States strengthened, Schultz and his  colleagues moved rapidly to develop the company’s international presence. Building on the company’s early success in Japan, the stores opened in Europe and the Middle East as well as Asia in the late 1990s. Senior managers followed similar strategies to those they had used in launching Starbucks’ first store outside North America in Tokyo. In most countries, they selected a local business partner to help them recruit talented individuals, set up supplier relationships, and understand market conditions. “We are only as good as the people on the ground, so choosing the right partner is really important,” said Behar, the first president of Starbucks International.  Once Starbucks selected a joint-venture partner in a specific country, such as Sazaby (the national retailer with which Starbucks worked in Japan), executives from the partnering company traveled to Seattle for an intensive training program on Starbucks’ products, brand, and organization. According to Behar, success in international outlets depended critically on effective communication among managers, employees, and customers in each market: “If you want to put down real roots  in  a country and become part of a particular culture, you have to go in thinking ‘how can  we  serve people?’ Not only in terms of meeting customers’ needs, but also in terms of meeting our partners  and Starbucks’ needs. This means responding to a wide range of priorities beyond purely financial issues.”  Starbucks pursued a different strategy in entering the United Kingdom in 1998. Instead of selecting a British joint-venture partner with which the retailer would work to build a national presence, Starbucks acquired Seattle Coffee Company, a London-based coffee bar chain founded by two American émigrés. Schultz and his colleagues hoped that the business would serve as  a  launching pad for future expansion in Europe. To help build brand awareness in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, senior managers planned to convert the Seattle Coffee Company outlets to Starbucks stores as well as open new Starbucks locations throughout the United Kingdom.  At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Starbucks had more than 500 stores outside North America. More than 12 million people a week visited Starbucks at 3,300 outlets.  By late 2000, Starbucks revenues totaled almost $2.2 billion. During the next two years, the company planned to open more than 1,000 new stores in Europe and Asia.177 Measured by projected store openings, this was rapid-fire expansion. Schultz saw still more growth ahead for his  organization of 37,000 people: “Adults all over the world drink approximately two cups of coffee  every day. Most of that coffee is not very good.” Starbucks, he continued, has “an unbelievable opportunity to build an enduring global brand.”178 He and other senior managers hoped to open “at least 20,000 locations worldwide, with as many as 10,000 locations in international markets.”

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        By 2000, the burgeoning market for specialty beans and beverages had permanently altered how American consumers thought about, purchased, and enjoyed coffee. More than 21 million men and women—about one in five daily drinkers—chose specialty coffee. Many ground it in their own  kitchens using high-quality arabica blends, varietals, or single country-of-origin beans.180 Others bought dark-roast coffee, caffe lattes, or other specialty drinks away from home at restaurants, fast- food outlets, and cafés and kiosks. Whether they made it themselves or not, regular drinkers had become much more interested in and knowledgeable about coffee, including its sources, preparation, aroma, flavor nuances, and social possibilities.  Expanding distribution channels for specialty coffee outlets, particularly coffeehouses and cafés where people gathered to talk, read, even conduct business, attracted other consumers. In 1991, for example, 34 million Americans drank coffee occasionally; eight years later, 63 million did.181 Many of these occasional consumers, especially men and women between the ages of 18 and 24, bought cappuccino, iced coffee, or other specialty drinks.182 These beverages generally tasted better and cost more than most of the leading coffees sold in U.S. supermarkets. For many individuals, such consumption also encompassed an element of self-definition that had not been part of the traditional “cuppa Joe.”  For millions of men and women not only in the United States but also in Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, coffee had ceased being a commodity that they evaluated primarily on the basis of price. Instead, it had become a differentiated offering that they assessed in relation to its quality, convenience, social ambience, and possibilities for self-expression.  How did so many people come to spend more time, energy, and money on the traditional beverage? Why did 25-year-old software programmers, middle-aged academics, and retired firemen all include double lattes in their everyday routines? How were these changes related to larger social and economic shifts and to business innovations that tapped into such shifts?  Schultz had started thinking about the potential coffee market in the early 1980s. He could see that a number of demographic, economic, and social developments were creating new consumer preferences and enhancing the significance of specific older ones. As his ideas about the demand side of the specialty coffee market took shape, he envisioned an offering—a particular retail experience  that revolved around high-quality coffee but that also included personal, knowledgeable service and sociability—that met these emerging needs. He and his colleagues set out to make this experience appealing to millions of people, constructing a compelling identity for Starbucks products, stores,   and the larger organization. By the late 1990s, consumers in a dozen countries associated the Starbucks brand with fine coffee, accessible elegance, community, individual expression, and control.  As the business grew, the entrepreneur and other managers worked to build a set  of organizational capabilities that consistently delivered on the promises of the Starbucks brand. Most  of these initiatives were very successful, and many of the innovations that Starbucks developed to make a market for specialty coffee, such as made-to-order beverages and attractive cafés, rapidly became industry standards. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the company was  the  leading global player in the young, growing market for specialty coffee. This position depended critically, as Schultz and others realized, on Starbucks’ consistent ability to interest, understand, and empathize with consumers around the world.
